* **Guest presentation** (10-20m): [Ticha Sethapakdi](https://www.tichamelody.com/) — CMU CFA+CS'17; PhD candidate in the HCI Engineering Group, MIT.
* **Experiment 1** Presentations by: Alex, Aren, Carina, Christy, Claire, Jeffrey, Merlin, Vincent, Willie, Xiao, Zhuoyang.
* Next up: Experiment Two presentations are due Feb-23/25.
* **For Monday February 2nd:** In the Discord channel, `#experiment-2-ideation`, write up a brief proposal for your second experiment. (If you have two different ideas and can't decide, write up both, but I'd prefer you pick one.) Provide a few sentences to describe the idea, what it is, why you want to make it, links to any relevant inspirations or works-in-progress. Include an image (which could be a napkin sketch if necessary). *We will discuss these proposals in a round robin of 4-5 person pods on Monday.*
